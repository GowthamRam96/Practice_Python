HSV Color Scale: The HSV (which stands for Hue Saturation Value) scale provides a numerical readout of your image that corresponds to the color names contained therein. Hue is measured in degrees from 0 to 360. For instance, cyan falls between 181–240 degrees, and magenta falls between 301–360 degrees. The value and saturation of a color are both analyzed on a scale of 0 to 100 percent. Most digital color pickers are based on the HSV scale, and HSV color models are particularly useful for selecting precise colors for art, color swatches, and digital graphics.

HSV - **Hue saturation Value** has more color distinction in certain cases where RGB might not do good.
